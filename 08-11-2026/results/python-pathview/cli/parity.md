| Render | Overlay on KEGG PNG | yes | yes | n/a |  |
| Render | Vector map drawn from coordinates | yes | partial | yes | R pathview's graph mode uses Rgraphviz; this draws KEGG's own layout |

| Render | PDF output | yes | yes | yes |  |
| Render | PNG output | yes | yes | yes |  |
| Render | Graph/network view with edges | yes | yes | n/a |  |

| Sources | KEGG download | yes | yes | yes |  |
| Sources | Reactome SBGN download | yes | no | yes |  |
| Sources | Pre-generated SBGN collection | yes | n/a | yes | 5,206 pathways indexed in the wheel; files fetched on demand and cached, so nothing unused is downloaded |
| Sources | Collection browsable offline | yes | n/a | partial | The index ships in the wheel; SBGNview.data must be installed in full (69 MB) to list its contents |
| Sources | PANTHER download | yes | n/a | yes | 152 pathways via the pre-generated collection |
| Sources | MetaCyc download | yes | n/a | yes | 2,518 pathways; BioCyc's own API needs a subscription |
| Sources | SMPDB download | yes | n/a | yes | 725 pathways; SMPDB publishes only bulk archives |
| Sources | MetaCrop download | yes | n/a | yes | 62 crop-plant metabolic pathways |
| Sources | Local SBGN files from any source | yes | n/a | yes | A hand-exported file parses identically to a downloaded one; there is no second code path |
| Sources | Pathway search by name | yes | no | yes |  |
| SBGN | Top-level SBGN render entry point | yes | n/a | yes | sbgnview() is to SBGN what pathview() is to KEGG |
| SBGN | Omics overlay on SBGN glyphs | yes | no | yes | Tries every identifier system the glyphs might use and keeps whichever lands on the map |
| SBGN | SBGN batch rendering | yes | n/a | yes |  |
| SBGN | Arc-class styling | yes | n/a | yes |  |
| SBGN | Process / operator glyph rendering | yes | n/a | yes |  |
| SBGN | Compartment-aware layout extent | yes | n/a | yes | The canvas is widened so shading is never clipped |
| Engineering | Typed errors | yes | no | no |  |
| Engineering | Mapping diagnostics returned | yes | partial | partial |  |
| Engineering | Disk cache with TTL | yes | partial | partial | R caches KGML files only |
| Engineering | Retry with backoff | yes | no | no |  |
| Engineering | Enforced offline mode | yes | no | no |  |
| Engineering | Command-line interface | yes | no | no |  |
| Engineering | Graph metrics | yes | no | no |  |
| Engineering | Multi-pathway batch in one call | yes | yes | yes | A failed pathway is recorded rather than aborting the batch, and modifiers broadcast across the set |
| Engineering | Reads R .RData without R | yes | n/a | n/a | XDR reader covering the vectors and lists reference data is published as; factors, closures and S4 raise rather than guess |
